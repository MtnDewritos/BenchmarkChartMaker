# BenchmarkChartMaker
Takes benchmark.txt files generated by MSI AfterBurner and makes a nice-ish looking chart out of them.

Takes benchmark.txt files from the benchmarks folder and spits out per-game charts with data from each text file that contains the given game into the images folder.

The filename of each text file is what shows up as the part name in the benchmark charts. 

Each benchmark.txt file needs to be edited with a line before every benchmark result that states the resolution and settings preset used (e.g. "Low 640x480").

See included files in the benchmarks directory and images directory to see how it works in practice.
